    "Definitions Python is a language orientated around protocols - Some behavior or syntax or bytecode or some top level function and there is a way to tell python how to implement that on an arbitrary object via underscore methods. The exact correspondance is usually guessable, but if you can't guess it you can it... google python data model\n",
